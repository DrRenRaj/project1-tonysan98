# Auto Body Shop Management System (BSMS)
### Tony Sandoval
### Android App Project 

In an auto body shop, effective project management is crucial for tracking job progress and ensuring timely completion. However, many shops struggle with keeping organized records of ongoing jobs, their stages, and the availability of necessary parts. This often leads to inefficiencies and delays.

To address this issue, I will develop a simple yet functional Android app that facilitates project management for auto body shops. The app will allow users to create and manage job entries, track their progress through various stages (from estimate to completion), and monitor parts availability for each job. The app will feature a user-friendly interface with a navigation menu, authentication for secure access, and data visualization to provide insights into job statistics. By implementing these features, the app will help auto body shops streamline their operations, improve organization, and enhance overall productivity.

**Features Overview**

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration to ensure data privacy.
- **Project Management**: Create, read, update, and delete job entries with details such as customer information, vehicle details, and job description.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor the stages of each job from estimate to completion.
- **Parts Management**: Keep track of parts availability for each job to ensure smooth workflow.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts for job status updates.
- **Data Visualization**: Simple charts to visualize job statistics and track performance.

This app aims to provide a clear, organized way for auto body shops to manage their projects, ensuring that every job is accounted for and completed efficiently.
